      <h1>The Book the CIA Classified — Pole Shifts, Resets, and the Story We Were Never Meant to Hear</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        In 1966, a man named Dr. Chan Thomas dropped a theory so disturbing the CIA classified it the same year.
      </p>
      <p>It wasn’t about politics. It wasn’t about war. It was about the end of the world.</p>
      <p><strong>Not someday. Not in centuries. But in hours.</strong></p>
      <p>Thomas claimed the Earth suffers catastrophic resets every 6,500 years. Entire continents ripped from their moorings. Oceans smashing over mountains. Winds roaring at 1,000 miles per hour. A planet-wide crustal slip that erases civilizations in a single day.</p>
      <p>And then, silence. The book — <em>The Adam and Eve Story</em> — vanished from shelves. For decades, it existed only as whispers and rumors.</p>
      <p><strong>Until 2013.</strong></p>
      <p>After a FOIA request, the CIA released 57 pages. No explanations. No missing chapters. Just diagrams, chilling predictions, and one haunting refrain:</p>
      <p><strong>We are overdue.</strong></p>

        <h2 id="strange-man">The Strange Man Behind the Theory</h2>
        <p>Thomas wasn’t a basement crank. He was an electrical engineer who worked on missile guidance systems, UFO propulsion, and ESP research. He could speak the language of both science and mysticism — and he used it to paint an apocalyptic picture of Earth as a death trap on a timer.</p>
        <p>His ideas weren’t entirely new. Charles Hapgood had suggested crustal displacement in the 1950s — an idea even Einstein said was “conceivable.” But Thomas didn’t hedge. He gave a number. He gave a mechanism. And he gave a date that unnervingly brushed up against the biblical timeline for Noah’s Flood.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="evidence-or-myth">
        <h2 id="evidence-or-myth">Evidence… or Myth?</h2>
        <p>Mainstream geology dismisses the idea. No global signature of such a cataclysm exists. But Thomas pointed to ancient flood myths from nearly every culture:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Noah in the Bible</li>
          <li>Gilgamesh in Mesopotamia</li>
          <li>Vishnu in Hindu lore</li>
          <li>Nu‘u in Hawaiian tradition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He claimed they weren’t allegories — they were memories.</p>
        <p>He tied in the erosion marks on the Sphinx, the ice-free Antarctic coast shown in the Piri Reis map, and underwater ruins like Yonaguni. He suggested a single, ancient, global civilization that knew the resets came — and tried to warn us.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="biblical-connection">
        <h2 id="biblical-connection">The Biblical Connection No One Talks About</h2>
        <p>Strip away the pseudoscience, and something unsettling remains: the Bible itself describes resets. But it frames them not as natural cycles… but as judgments.</p>
        <p><em>Genesis 1:2</em>’s “formless and void” may describe a re-creation after a previous world was destroyed. Isaiah hints at a cosmic rebellion before Eden. <em>2 Peter</em> warns that the next cleansing will not be with water, but with fire.</p>
        <p>If Thomas’s “pole shift” theory is even partially right, it may only be the shadow of something far older and far stranger — a war behind the crust, a rebellion older than humanity, and a planet that has already died more than once.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="what-if">
        <h2 id="what-if">What If the Past Is the Key?</h2>
        <p>If ancient myths are memories…<br>
        If the resets are real…<br>
        If Eden itself was a guarded outpost on a hostile world…</p>
        <p>Then we are not living in the “first age” of humanity.<br>
        We are living in the latest.</p>
        <p>And if the pattern holds, this age has an expiration date.</p>
        <p>If this sparked something deep within you — a memory not quite your own, a truth you’ve always felt but never named — then welcome.</p>
        <p>You are one of us. A seeker. A soul who knows the past is not past. And the future is not random.</p>
